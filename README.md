MATLAB Figures Tool Box
==================================
This package contains some useful matlab scripts to generate figures that are edited to be near publication ready

Use `help filename` for a sample usage of each file and various options that exist

Manifold Traverser
------------------
This package now contains a function that can be used to trace a 2D/3D manifold that can be used as an agnostic tool to for Manifold Learning.

In simple terms, given a 2D/3D data and its corresponding high dimensional vectors (such as time series) it produces MATLAB figues where you can intreactively click a point on the manifold and corresponding high dimenisonal response will be plotted in the window next to it

Use `help manifold_click_traverse` for a sample usage of the script.
